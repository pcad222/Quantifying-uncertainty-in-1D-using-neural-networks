# Quantifying-uncertainty-in-1D-using-neural-networks
 The approach involves creating a fully connected neural network with one hidden layer containing 64 neurons. The model is trained to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) loss. After training, the model is used to predict the output, and the residuals are calculated. Since the model is trained using 50 independent seeds (due to random weight initialization), the residuals will be similar but not identical across different seeds.  From the variation of residual, we find the standard deviation at every location. Finally, we get the uncertainty at every location.
